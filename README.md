# Video Games Sales Analysis

## Description
This games sales dataset provides insights into the average gamer lifestyle and gaming choices in the three major markets: North America, Europe, and Japan. Despite significant missing values in ratings and scores, after data cleaning, the dataset revealed several useful insights:
- No obvious correlations between user/critic ratings and total sales/market shares.
- Identified lifecycle patterns for game systems and used these to predict 2017 sales trends for PS4 and Xbox One.
- Found that Playstation is the leading manufacturer in sales, with 3 of the 6 platforms with the highest average sales.
- Built user profiles for North America, Europe, and Japan.
- Created independent samples to test two hypotheses and analyzed the results.

## Installation
To work with this project, you will need the following Python libraries:
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- SciPy

## Usage
The dataset can be used to explore various hypotheses. For example, using the null hypothesis to test sales predictions or correlations between ratings and market shares.
